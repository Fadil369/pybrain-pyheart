8. **Quality Checks**: All packages pass twine validation

### 📋 Build Results:
```
pybrain-pkg/dist/
├── pybrain-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (23.8 KB)
└── pybrain-0.1.0.tar.gz (25.7 KB)

pyheart-pkg/dist/
├── pyheart-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (21.2 KB)
└── pyheart-0.1.0.tar.gz (25.2 KB)
```

Both packages **PASSED** twine validation checks ✅

## 🚀 Ready for Publication

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Set up PyPI accounts** (if not already done)
2. **Configure authentication** (~/.pypirc file)
3. **Test on TestPyPI first**:
   ```bash
   cd pybrain-pkg
   python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   
   cd ../pyheart-pkg
   python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

4. **Publish to production PyPI**:
   ```bash
   cd pybrain-pkg
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   
   cd ../pyheart-pkg
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

### Automated Script Available:
Run `python build_and_publish.py` for automated building and publishing guidance.

## 💡 Package Capabilities

### PyBrain Usage Examples:
```python
from pybrain import AIEngine, DataHarmonizer, DecisionEngine

# AI-powered clinical analysis
ai = AIEngine()
entities = ai.extract_clinical_entities("Patient has diabetes and hypertension")

# Data harmonization
harmonizer = DataHarmonizer()
fhir_patient = harmonizer.harmonize_to_fhir(hl7_data, "hl7v2", "Patient")

# Clinical decision support
decision = DecisionEngine()
recommendations = decision.evaluate_patient(patient_data)
```

### PyHeart Usage Examples:
```python
from pyheart import FHIRClient, WorkflowEngine, IntegrationHub

# FHIR connectivity
client = FHIRClient("https://fhir.hospital.com")
patient = client.get_patient("12345")

# Workflow orchestration
engine = WorkflowEngine()
instance_id = await engine.start_process("patient-admission", vars)

# Multi-system integration
hub = IntegrationHub()
await hub.connect_system("ehr", FHIRAdapter("hospital_ehr"))
```

### CLI Commands:
```bash
# PyBrain
pybrain analyze -t "Clinical text to analyze"
pybrain harmonize -i data.json -f hl7v2 -r Patient

# PyHeart
pyheart fhir -s https://server.com -r Patient -i 123
pyheart workflow -f process.json --watch
pyheart doctor  # System diagnostics
```
